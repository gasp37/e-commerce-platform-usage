# E-commerce Platform Usage

Business Problem: An e-commerce company aims to imprrove its online platforms to increase customer retention and encourage higher purchasing. However, due to limited funds, they can only invest in either their app or website. The company has shared data on time spent, usage patterns, and money spent on both platforms. They seek insights on which platform would present a better return on investment (ROI).

To do so, we will analyze spending patterns and formulate a regression model. This model will enable us to predict how an increase in time spent on each platform will affect the spending habits.
